Riders.Tweakbox.API is a work in progress Web API service that provides various services to [Riders.Tweakbox](https://github.com/Sewer56/Riders.Tweakbox), an all in one game modification for Sonic Riders.

It represents my first proper deeper dive into ASP.NET Web API outside of modifying existing applications. As time goes, this becomes more features are added to this server depending on the requirements of the mod.

# Features

✔ User Registration (incl. Password Reset)\
✔ Mail Service (e.g. Registration Confirmation)\
✔ Geolocation & Self-updating GeoIP Database\
✔ Transparent to end-users & (hopefully) GDPR Compliant.\
✔ Live Server Browser\
✔ Ranked Matchmaking
  - Solo, 1v1, 2v2, 2v2v2, 2v2v2v2 etc.

✔ Match Result Tracking
  - Including stats such as gear, character, fastest lap etc.
  
✔ Player Rating System (inspired by TrueSkill)\
✔ Built-in Swagger API Testing Site\
✔ Built-in .NET SDK/Library

As the main project (Riders.Tweakbox) is still not fully mature in terms of Netplay stability, it will take some time for ranked play to be implemented; however, it will happen eventually.
