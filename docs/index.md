Riders.Tweakbox.API is a work in progress Web API service that provides various services to [Riders.Tweakbox](https://github.com/Sewer56/Riders.Tweakbox), an all in one game modification for Sonic Riders.

It represents my first proper deeper dive into ASP.NET Web API outside of modifying existing applications. As time goes, this becomes more features are added to this server depending on the requirements of the mod.

As the main project (Riders.Tweakbox) is still not fully mature in terms of Netplay stability, it will take some time for ranked play to be implemented; however, it will happen eventually.
